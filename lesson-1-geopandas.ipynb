    "\n",
    "GeoPandas is a Python library that extends the `pandas` library by adding support for geospatial data. In this lesson we will introduce the `geopandas` library to work with vector data. We will also make our first map. \n",
    "\n",
    "To begin with, let's import `geopandas` with its standard abbreviation `gpd`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{python}\n",
    "# this is the library we will explore\n",
    "import geopandas as gpd\n",
    "\n",
    "# we will start using matplotlib for making maps\n",

    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson we will use simplified point data about wild pigs (*Sus scrofa*) sightings in California, USA from the [Global Biodiversity Information Facility](https://www.gbif.org). \n",
    "\n",
    "We can read in a shapefile with `geopandas` by using the `gpd.read_file()` function. \n",
    "\n",
    "```{python}\n",
    "pigs = gpd.read_file('data/gbif_sus_scroga_california/gbif_sus_scroga_california.shp')\n",
    "pigs.head()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "::: {.callout-caution}\n",
    "## One shapefile = multiple files\n",
    "Although the parameter for `gpd.read_file()` is only the `.shp` file, remember that we need to have at least the `.shx` and `.dbf` files in the same directory as the `.shp` to read in the data. \n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "## `GeoSeries` and `GeoDataFrame`\n",
    "\n",
    "The core data structure in GeoPandas is the `geopandas.GeoDataFrame`. \n",
    "We can think of it as a `pandas.DataFrame` with a dedicated geometry column that can perform spatial operations. \n",
    "\n",
    "The **geometry column** in a `gpd.GeoDataFrame` holds the geometry (point, polygon, etc) of each spatial feature. Columns in the `gpd.GeoDataFrame` with attributes about the features are `pandas.Series` like in a regular `pd.DataFrame`. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Image source: GeoPandas documentation](/images/lesson-8-geopandas/dataframe.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, notice that the leftmost column of `pigs` is a column named `geometry` whose values indicate points. \n",
    "\n",
    "```{python}\n",
    "pigs.head(3)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As usual, we can check the type of our objects using the `type` Python function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{python}\n",
    "# type of the pigs dataframe \n",
    "print(type(pigs))\n",
    "\n",
    "# type of the geometry column\n",
    "print(type(pigs.geometry))\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## Geometric information\n",
    "\n",
    "Two other important attributes of a `gpd.GeoDataFrame` are its coordinate reference system (CRS) and its extent. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can think of the **coordinate reference system (CRS)** as the instructions to locate each feature in our dataframe on the surface of the Earth. We access the CRS of a `gpd.GeoDataFrame` using the `crs` attribute:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{python}\n",
    "# access the CRS of the GeoDataFrame\n",
    "pigs.crs\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The **extent** of the geo-dataframe is the bounding box covering *all* the features in our geo-dataframe. This is formed by finding the points that are furthest west, east, south and north.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Spatial extent of different vector data. Image Source: National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON)](/images/lesson-8-geopandas/spatial-extent.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We access the extent of a `gpd.GeoDataFrame` using the `total_bounds` attribute:\n",

    "pigs.total_bounds\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data wrangling\n",
    "\n",
    "GeoPandas is conveniently built on top of `pandas`, so we may use  everything we have learned about data selection, wrangling, and modification for a `pd.DataFrame`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we only want to use recent data for wild pig observations. A quick check shows that this dataframe has data since 1818:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{python}\n",
    "# use sort_index() method to order the index\n",
    "pigs.year.value_counts().sort_index()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use our usual data selection to get data from 2020 onwards:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{python}\n",
    "# selet data from 2020 onwards\n",
    "pigs_recent = pigs[pigs.year>=2020]\n",
    "\n",
    "# print length of original dataframe\n",
    "print(len(pigs))\n",
    "\n",
    "# check length of new dataframe\n",
    "len(pigs_recent)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Plotting\n",
    "\n",
    "### `plot()`\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly to a `pd.DataFrame`, a `gpd.GeoDataFrame` has a `plot()` method that we can call directly to create a quick view of our data. \n",
    "The geospatial information of the `gpd.GeoDataFrame` will be used to create the axes of the plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a quick look at our recent pigs data:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{python}\n",
    "pigs_recent.plot()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### `matplotlib`'s `fig` and `ax`\n",
    "\n",
    "Going forward, we will often want to make more complex visualizations where we add different layers to a graph and customize it. \n",
    "To do this we will use the `matplotlib` Python library for creating visualizations. \n",
    "We can interact with `matplotlib` via its `pyplot` interface, which we imported at the top of the notebook as \n",
    "```python\n",
    "# import matplotlib with standard abbreviation\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Matplotlib graphs the data in a **figure** which can have one or more **axes**. \n",
    "The axis is only the area specified by the x-y axis and what is plotted in it. To create a new blank figure:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialize a new figure and axes by calling `pyplot`'s `subplots()` function, and\n",
    "2. show the graph using `plt.show()`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{python}\n",
    "# create a blank figure (fig) with an empty axis (ax)\n",
    "fig, ax = plt.subplots()\n",
    "\n",
    "# display figure\n",
    "plt.show()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice we get a figure with a single empty axis. We can think of this step as setting a new blank canvas on which we will paint upon. \n",
    "\n",
    "::: {.callout-note}\n",
    "## Functions with multiple return values\n",
    "Notice that `plt.subplots()` is a function that returns two objects (has two outputs). \n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding a layer\n",
    "\n",
    "When using `matplotlib`, it can be useful to think of creating a plot as adding layers to an axis.\n",
    "The general syntax to plot a datafram `df` onto an axis is:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# create new figure and axis\n",
    "fig, ax = plt.subplots()\n",
    "\n",
    "# plot df on the ax axis\n",
    "df.plot(ax=ax, \n",
    "        ...)   # other arguments for plot function\n",
    "\n",
    "# display figure\n",
    "plt.show()\n",
    "``` \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "The first layer we want to add to our axis is the `pigs_recent` point data. \n",
    "We can plot our data using `matplotlib` like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{python}\n",
    "# create new figure and axis\n",
    "fig, ax = plt.subplots()\n",
    "\n",
    "# add pigs point plot to our figure's axis\n",
    "pigs_recent.plot(ax=ax)\n",
    "\n",
    "# display figure\n",
    "plt.show\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Customization \n",
    "\n",
    "Matplotlib allows for a lot of customization. \n",
    "Some of it can be done directly in the `plot()` method for the dataframe (like we've done when ploting data using `pandas`), while other is done by updating attributes of the axis `ax`. \n",
    "The following image shows some examples of elements in the axis that can be updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Image source: Matplotlib documentation](/images/lesson-8-geopandas/anatomy.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "Some basic customization for our pigs data could looke like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{python}\n",
    "# initialize empty figure\n",

    "\n",
    "# add data to axis\n",
    "# notice customization happens as arguments in plot()\n",

    "                 color='brown'\n",
